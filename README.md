# Webapp React 

## Milestone 1 -- Done

- Install:
    - react-dom-router
    - bootstrap
    - bootstrap-icon


## Milestone 2 -- Done
- Create layout (probably a grid)
- Create Routes:
    - Film List (HomePage)
    - Single Film with reviews (FilmDetailPage)


### Creating design based on db structure

In HomePage will be a sort of thumbnail of each film, so I would use these fields: title, thumbnail. (From db)
For style, I can add a button to go to the single film and its reviews

I don't have images to show, so I will use placeholders (https://via.placeholder.com/150/92c952)
